# %%
# In this example, we want to showcase how it is possible to make new
# functional basis compatible with :class:`~skfda.FDataBasis`, by
# subclassing the :class:`Basis` class.
#
# Suppose that we already know that our data belongs to (or can be
# reasonably approximated in) the functional space spanned by the basis
# :math:`\{f(t) = \sin(6t), g(t) = t^2\}`. We can define these two functions
# in Python as follows (remember than the input and output are both NumPy
# arrays).


def f(t):
    return np.sin(6 * t)


def g(t):
    return t**2


# %%
# Lets now define the functional basis. We create a subclass of :class:`Basis`
# containing the definition of our desired basis. We need to overload the
# ``__init__`` method in order to add the necessary parameters for the creation
# of the basis. :class:`Basis` requires both the domain range and the number of
# elements in the basis in order to work. As this particular basis has fixed
# size, we only expose the ``domain_range`` parameter in the constructor, but
# we still pass the fixed size to the parent class constructor.
#
# It is also necessary to override the protected ``_evaluate`` method, that
# defines the evaluation of the basis elements.

class MyBasis(Basis):

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        domain_range=None,
    ):
        super().__init__(domain_range=domain_range, n_basis=2)

    def _evaluate(
        self,
        eval_points,
    ):
        return np.vstack([
            f(eval_points),
            g(eval_points),
        ])


# %%
# We can now create an instance of this basis and plot it.

basis = MyBasis()
basis.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# This simple definition already allows to represent functions and work with
# them, but it does not allow advanced functionality such as taking derivatives
# (because it does not know how to derive the basis elements!). In order to
# add support for that we would need to override the appropriate methods (in
# this case, ``_derivative_basis_and_coefs``).
#
# In this particular case, we are not interested in the derivatives, only in
# correct representation and evaluation. We can now test the conversion from
# :class:`FDataGrid` to :class:`~skfda.FDataBasis` for elements in this space.

# %%
# We first define a (discretized) function in the space spanned by :math:`f`
# and :math:`g`.

t = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
data_matrix = [
    2 * f(t) + 3 * g(t),
    5 * f(t) - 2 * g(t),
]

X = FDataGrid(data_matrix, grid_points=t)
X.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# We can now convert it to our basis, and visually check that the
# representation is exact.

X_basis = X.to_basis(basis)
X_basis.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# If we inspect the coefficients, we can finally guarantee that they are the
# ones used in the initial definition.
